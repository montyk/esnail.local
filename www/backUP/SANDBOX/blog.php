          <h2>The cost of a PO Box</h2>

      <p>A friend of mine who is into marketing once told me that Canada Post is one of the most valuable brands in existence.  By that he meant not the service it provides but the goodwill that the name holds with its users who view it as a trustworthy and efficient service.  Personally I like Canada Post.  I prefer it to companies like UPS, DHL and TNT who principally provide the maddening service of posting those sticky notices telling you that you can't have your package because you- as you were already aware- were not at home.  Isn't that what a postal box is for?  Canada Post has never had trouble delivering or holding on to a package for weeks at a nearby postal outlet- but many of the big courier companies have actually returned packages without my consent because it was not convenient for them to deliver it at a time when I could sign for it.</p>
      <p>According to a Boston.com article, it seems that the US postal service is in a bit of <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-04-17/business/31356274_1_mail-volume-postal-service-first-class-mail-delivery">trouble</a> lately due to online communication and bills.</p>
      <p>I hope that eSnail.ca is on the side of Canada Post, rather than being one of those companies that are slowly causing it to go the way of the Cotton Gin.  Perhaps a day like today is  good one to reaffirm that Canada Post is eSnail.ca's first choice when it comes to forwarding packages and letters.  We do this not because it is the most cost-effective option, (though it often is) but because it is the most convenient for our users and because Canada Post offers a high level of service for rural and remote addresses. Canada Post is a company with vision who puts service above convenience and profit.  That's exactly the kind of company eSnail.ca hopes to be. </p>
      <p>Have a great day,</p>

          <h2>World's Highest Paid Letter Opener</h2>
           28th of April 2012

      <p>It's nice to see positive change happening in the world.  A friend of mine sent me a link to <a href="http://www.post.ch/en/post-startseite/post-swisspostbox.htm">this</a> company in Switzerland which has begun to offer scanning and storage online.  Unfortunately they are running the business on the same principle as Earth Class Mail, an Oregon based startup that offers a similar service as eSnail.ca. Basically their service involves scanning the envelope- ONLY the envelope- and then asking the user to pay $1.50 just to send you a scanned copy of the envelope's actual contents.</p>
      <p>While we wish our friends at Swiss Post and Earth Class Mail the best it seems to us rather silly to make our users wait a full day just to see the contents of their mail- let alone to charge $1.50 for us to use a letter opener.   I can't speak for everyone, but I open every piece of mail with my name on it- which still makes up the bulk of the mail I personally receive.  If I kept an account at Earth Class Mail, It would drive me batty wondering what's in the envelope each time I received and wondering if it was worth it to pay the $1.50 to open it.</p>
      <p>The only thing worse than having a frustrated customer is being a frustrated customer.  So let us know how we're doing.</p>
      <p>Until next entry, have a great day.</p>
