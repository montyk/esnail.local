	<h1>Plans</h1>
    <p>Not every business or individual has the same needs.  Some of us are looking for a solution to not having to drive out to that laneway PO box, some are moving away for college and aren't interested in forwarding their mail for years, still others are looking to relieve the workload that physical mail handling places on their company.</p>
	<p>So whether you're expecting hundreds of pieces of mail a month or just one, we've got the plan that suits you best.</p>
