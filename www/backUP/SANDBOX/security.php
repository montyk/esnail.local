<h1>Security</h1>

<p>At eSnail.ca we're more than a mail handling company, we're a security company.  We understand that security is one of the most important considerations you make when choosing a mail handling solution.  We want you assure you that your mail is safe at our company and on the servers that give you access to it 24/7.  Here is a list of just some of the protocols and measures we use to protect your privacy and security.</p>

        	<h3>Scanning</h3>
			<p>We assure you that your mail is never viewed by human eyes.  Using a technique derived from photographic film loading in labs, any mail received at eSnail.ca on yor behalf is opened and scanned by hand in 'blind' environment.  Our workers have special stations that allow for manual manipulation of the documents without visibility.  Like an incubator or a film changing tent.  This measure ensures that the envelopes are opened, scanned and resealed in security envelopes without ever revealing the contents.  Once the scan is complete, the security envelopes and mail are placed in secure storage.</p>

    	<td>
        	<h3>Employee Security</h3>
            <p>Our office's most sensitive areas are limited only to employees. Each new hire as well as every staff member who is granted access to the scanning room must pass a federal criminal records check before being hired. Though staff are not at any time permitted to access user account information passwords or the contents of mail, all staff members must also sign a confidentiality agreement covering all client information. In addition to hiring reliable and honest employees our scanning area is kept under constant video surveillance.</p>

    	<td>
        	<h3>Document Shredding</h3>
            <p>All mail is stored in a secure on-site storage area for up to three months in case you should request a physical copy mailed to you.  Your mail is carefully filed and remains retrievable until you request it be forwarded to you. After three months the documents are shredded on site to eliminate the possibility of mail theft.  In order to ensure the security of your property at no time does the mail leave our offices.</p>

   <tr>
   		<td><img src="<?=$base;?>img/icons/account.png" alt="Account Security" title="Account Security" /></td>
    	<td>
        	<h3>Account Security</h3>
            <p>All communications with the e-snail website are conducted over an 256-bit SSL certified encrypted connection. If you choose to access your mail through our eLetter interface your session is encrypted from start to end.  All files are password-protected when they are transferred, ensuring security from our server to your desktop.  Extra security features help detect and inform you should your session ID come under attack. </p>
            <p>Should you choose the convenience of having your mail directly mailed to your inbox, each file is individually encrypted with a password of your choosing.  This encryption is done to the same standards used by the top companies in the financial services industry. Privacy and notification settings let you control what appears in your email inbox.</p>

   <tr>
   		<td><img src="<?=$base;?>img/icons/file.png" alt="File Security" title="File Security" /></td>
    	<td>
        	<h3>File Security</h3>
            <p>Our storage media uses full-disk encryption to protect your data in the physical world.  This gives you access to any mail in your account at any time but the full-disk encryption would take somewhere around 50 septemvigintillion years to crack.  All drives are redundant and kept in an offline storage that will archive mail several years old. Copies of archived mail that can be requested through the eLetter interface.</p>
            <p>Finally, you may at any time set an expiration date after which we securely erase any old files.</p>
